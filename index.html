                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Philosophy Statement: My personal goal as a dental hygienist is to influence my community towards a healthier and happier lifestyle that begins with motivational oral health. I am passionate about this profession since my influence was a very caring and compassionate dentist I had when I was growing up. I always felt comfortable in a dental chair, hence my desire to transmit the same sentiment to others. When I graduate, I plan on dedicating time at volunteer facilities that provide free dental service to the community. The professional impact that dental hygiene has in me is profound because I truly believe that an individual's well-being can improve by having a better oral health. Providing assistance during the client's journey is a personal joy that I like to bring.<br><br>
                    Reflection Statement: evidence of competence competency.</p>
                <p> It is crucial to obtain excellent x-ray images from our patients. They are the view of what the naked eye cannot see, hence the importance of being attentive to the details in order to catch any anomalies in the bone or periodontal supporting structures. <a href="https://e6add7b3-2ba3-4897-81a9-072727085414.filesusr.com/ugd/36da87_34a7b784705245d4b7958a290114b8e7.pdf" target=”_blank”>X-Ray Doc.</a><br><br>
                <p> Accurately observing the amount of plaque during disclosing is important in order to provide oral hygiene instructions that have the visual impact on the client's own perception. <a href="https://e6add7b3-2ba3-4897-81a9-072727085414.filesusr.com/ugd/36da87_1249e98946a142829ebb7f1e23734014.pdf" target=”_blank”>PI Doc.</a></p><br>
                <p> Medical assessment and management of the patient is crucial when preventing some contraindication to certain medical conditions. <a href="https://e6add7b3-2ba3-4897-81a9-072727085414.filesusr.com/ugd/36da87_294f39b1b53e4d45a93e3f020bd20850.pdf" target=”_blank”>Medical Assessment Doc.</a></p><br>
                    Sharpening instruments correctly provides safer treatment, more patient comfort and better clinician ergonomics. <a href="https://e6add7b3-2ba3-4897-81a9-072727085414.filesusr.com/ugd/36da87_cca48c51defd48a28cac26c62f1f8a3b.pdf" target=”_blank”>Sharpening Doc.</a></p>

We offered screening to Elementary Schools in the Los Angeles area with the goal of introducing dental concepts to the youth, as well as the parents if they were present.
